# b3dsdf ðŸ§°

b3dsdf (blender signed distance functions) is a toolkit of 2D/3D signed distance functions and operators nodegroups for the shader editor in Blender 2.83+.

These nodes can be used by appending from the .blend file or use them with the addon which adds a menu in the shader editor. They can also be used with the asset browser by adding the .blend as an asset library and marking them as assets.

## Geometry Nodes (Volume Cube)

As of [D15198](https://developer.blender.org/D15198) it is now possible to use the SDF nodes/operators from this pack via their Geometry Nodes equivalents in Blender 3.3 or above ([more details](https://twitter.com/lateasusual_/status/1537792086719795201))

Currently there's no plans to maintain another set of nodes/add-on but they can be converted for use with the [blender booster add-on](https://vsb.gumroad.com/l/blender_booster) by [Val Barashkov](https://twitter.com/ValeraBarashkov).

## Installation

Download the latest zip file from the [release page](https://github.com/williamchange/b3dsdf/releases) and install as normal. There's no need to unzip before installing. You might have to restart Blender for changes to take effect after installing / uninstalling.

Alternatively you have the option to install directly from source (code > download zip, or via repo cloning) which might include new features/nodes.

## Nodegroups

List of available nodegroups can be found in [shader_nodes.json](https://github.com/williamchange/b3dsdf/blob/master/shader_nodes.json). Examples (with images) can be found in the [wiki page](https://github.com/williamchange/b3dsdf/wiki/Examples) (work in progress).
